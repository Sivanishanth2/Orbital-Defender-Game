Orbital Defender is a visually engaging and challenging 2D arcade space shooter developed entirely in Java with the Swing GUI toolkit. The game puts you in control of a lone ship locked in a defensive orbit around a planet. Your mission is to survive as long as possible by destroying incoming asteroids with your mouse-aimed cannon.

This project was built to be a complete, standalone game application with a focus on a polished user experience and dynamic gameplay.

Key Features:
Unique Gameplay: Combines keyboard-based orbital movement with precise, mouse-based aiming and shooting, creating a fun and skillful challenge.

Polished User Experience: Features a full game loop, including a futuristic main menu, a pause screen, an interactive HUD, and a "Game Over" summary screen.

Custom Vector Graphics: All visuals—from the player's ship and asteroids to the explosions and UI—are rendered programmatically using Java 2D. No external image files are needed.

Progressive Difficulty: The game's intensity increases over time, with asteroids spawning more frequently and moving faster as your score climbs.

Object-Oriented Design: The code is cleanly structured, separating game logic, UI panels, and different space objects (ship, asteroids, projectiles) into their own classes.
